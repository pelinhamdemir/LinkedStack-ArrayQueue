The Main class contains the main method, which takes a string input from the user, calls the palindromeCheck method to check if the input string is a palindrome or not, and prints the result.
The ArrayQueue class implements a queue using an array. It contains an array to store the data, a size variable to keep track of the maximum size of the queue, an index variable to keep track of the current index, and a first variable to keep track of the first element in the queue. It has two methods: enqueue and dequeue. The enqueue method adds an element to the end of the queue, and the dequeue method removes and returns the first element of the queue.
The Node class represents a node in a singly linked list. It contains a data variable to store the data, a next variable to store the reference to the next node, and getter and setter methods for both variables.
The LinkedStack class implements a stack using a singly linked list. It contains a first variable to store the reference to the first node in the stack, and a count variable to keep track of the number of elements in the stack. It has three methods: isEmpty(), pop, and push. The isEmpty() method checks if the stack is empty. The pop method removes and returns the top element of the stack. The push method adds an element to the top of the stack.
